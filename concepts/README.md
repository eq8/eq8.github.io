# Concepts

The core library (`eq8-core`) has three building blocks:
  * [Events](./EVENTS.md)
  * [Queries](./QUERIES.md)
  * [Registrars](./registrars/README.md)

There are three default registrars that come with the main library (`eq8js`):
  * [Actions](./registrars/ACTIONS.md)
  * [Views](./registrars/VIEWS.md)
  * [Services](./registrars/SERVICES.md)
